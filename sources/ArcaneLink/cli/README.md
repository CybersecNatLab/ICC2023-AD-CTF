ArcaneLink - Command Line Interface
===================================

This is a simple CLI program to interact with the ArcaneLink device from the
command line.

Building
--------

Run the [`./build-deb.sh`](./build-deb.sh) script from this directory to build
two `.deb` packages: `arcane-cli-i386.deb` and `arcane-cli-arm64.deb`, that
are then ready to be installed through `apt`/`dpkg` inside the VMs.
